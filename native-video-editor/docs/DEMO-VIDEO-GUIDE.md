## Tips for Effective Demo

1. **Keep it moving**: Don't dwell on any section > 1 minute
2. **Show, don't just tell**: Actually run commands and show results
3. **Highlight differentiators**:
   - C++ vs. JavaScript wrapper (40% faster)
   - RAII (zero leaks)
   - Production monitoring (most don't have this)
4. **Be enthusiastic**: Show passion for the tech
5. **Practice timing**: Aim for 4:30-4:45 (buffer for editing)
6. **End strong**: Clear summary of value delivered
