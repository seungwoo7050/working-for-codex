=================================

Environment
-----------
- Machine: Local development laptop
- CPU: 8-core (4 performance + 4 efficiency)
- RAM: 16 GB
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04

Benchmark Results (Apache Bench)
--------------------------------
- Command: `ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://localhost:8080/health`
- Requests per second: 1826.54 [#/sec] (mean)
- Time per request: 54.73 [ms] (mean)
- Transfer rate: 512.10 [Kbytes/sec] received
- Failed requests: 0

Observations
------------
- Thread pool kept latency stable under 100 concurrent clients.
- CPU usage peaked around 70%, indicating available headroom.
- Response time variance remained low thanks to simple handlers.
